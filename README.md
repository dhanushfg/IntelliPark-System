The Autonomous Parking System is a smart solution designed to streamline the parking process in a two-story parking structure with a total capacity of 20 vehicles, 10 on each floor. Using advanced embedded systems, the solution integrates various sensors and controllers to ensure precision, efficiency, and convenience. Vehicles are equipped with infrared (IR) sensors that communicate with an embedded controller to navigate autonomously. Ultrasonic sensors strategically placed within the parking lot monitor distances in real-time, ensuring precise vehicle placement and preventing collisions.
An embedded controller processes the data from these sensors, guiding vehicles to the nearest available parking spots. A user-friendly OLED display provides real-time information on the number of parked vehicles, available spaces, and navigational guidance to the appropriate floor or parking zone, simplifying the process for drivers. The system optimizes space utilization, reduces time spent searching for parking, and enhances the overall parking experience in busy urban areas.
By seamlessly integrating real-time data processing and automation, the Autonomous Parking System offers a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly solution for modern parking challenges. It improves convenience for drivers, maximizes the use of limited space, and represents a significant step forward in smart urban infrastructure.
